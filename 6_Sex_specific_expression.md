# Sex specific expression

The male and females transcriptomes are a good opportunity to study sex-biased and sex-specific expression in second instar mealybugs. This analysis broadly follows the framework in 2_transcriptome -- it's a differential expression analysis between sexes, regardless of B presence or absence. We'll use the RSEM matrix generated by Isabelle.

### Preprocessing

Out of the 18,843 genes with at least a count in a single sample, if we do filtering with default settings (min.count = 10) we are left with 15,673 genes. The reason for choosing the default threshold is that now we are not that bothered by lowly expressed genes in both M and F.
